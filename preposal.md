# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I'm thinking of creating a murder mystery game/visual novel, with multiple endings, using Ren'py. I would likely draw the characters and maybe include minigames. Might include some kind of dice element, like the game Clue.
Alternatively, I could make a mock brand responsive webpage for my portfolio. However, the former sounds more fun.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

No.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

No.
