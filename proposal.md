# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Detective Beaver

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Murder mystery visual novel/game.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will use Ren'py and Adobe Creative Suite. It will use a rolling element to move around the mystery mansion. Also, there will be multiple endings, depending on if you figure out whodunnit. Using Adobe Creative Suite, I will make characters for the game. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

No.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

No.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

At the bare minumum, I will create a good murder mystery visual novel with two endings. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

All of the characters are designed by me. There is a rolling element.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

All of the characters and settings will be designed by me. There is a rolling element and mini-games.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to play around with Ren'py, as I have never used it. I want to research how to make mini-games in it.
